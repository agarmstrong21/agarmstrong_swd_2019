Name: Addison Armstrong
Name of Project: 18-20_MazeTraversal_Hard
Name of Class: Driver
Class Description: Driver class of Test, this will start up all the tests. There are four mazes that are pre-made
    for testing purposes.
Warnings: This driver will run a class of tests that use pre-made mazes. These tests will not 'fail' or 'success' but
    will still run. The program will print out if the maze is done or not. I will leave a maze creator and test empty
        for further testing purposes.
